Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of 
Hyrule while controlling Link. Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's
 lack of defined entrances or exits to areas, scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore 
 freely. Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, letting players approach 
 problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution. The game also integrates a "chemistry engine" 
 that defines the physical properties of most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.For example, 
 during thunderstorms, metal objects will attract powerful lightning strikes; during a storm, therefore, a player must be careful
 not to carry metal, but may also throw metal objects at enemies to draw lightning to them. These design approaches result in a generally
 unstructured and interactive world that rewards experimentation and allows for nonlinear completion of the story.

As Link, players can perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding with a paraglider, although Link is limited by his stamina.
 Link can procure items from the environment, including weapons, food, and other resources. Unlike previous Zelda games, weapons and shields degrade 
 through use, eventually shattering. Many items have multiple uses; for example, wooden weapons can light fires, wooden shields can collect incoming
 enemy arrows, and shields can be used as makeshift snowboards. Players can obtain food and materials for elixirs from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit,
 or collecting parts of defeated enemies. By cooking combinations of food or materials, the player can create meals and elixirs that can replenish Link's health
 and stamina, or provide temporary status bonuses such as increased strength or resistance to heat or cold. An important tool in Link's arsenal is the "Sheikah Slate",
 a magical stone tablet which can be used to mark waypoints on the in-game map and take pictures of materials, creatures, and enemies. These pictures are stored in an in-game
 compendium that can be used to locate valuable items. The Sheikah Slate also gives the player the ability to create remote bombs, manipulate metal objects, form ice blocks on watery 
 surfaces, and temporarily stop objects in time. In combat, players can lock onto targets for more precise attacks, while certain button combinations allow for advanced offensive and 
 defensive moves. Players may also defeat enemies without weapons, such as by rolling boulders off cliffs into enemy camps.
</p>

Besides exploration, players can undergo quests or challenges to obtain certain benefits. Activating towers and shrines will add waypoints to the map that the player may warp to at any time.
 Activating towers also adds territories to the map, although location names are not added until the player explores that area. Dotted throughout Hyrule are shrines that contain challenges
 ranging from puzzles to battles against robotic opponents. Clearing shrines earns Spirit Orbs; after earning four of these orbs, they can be traded for additional health or stamina points.
 When Link has at least 13 hearts, he can reclaim the Master Sword in the Korok Forest. The Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, but it can run out of energy after extended use,
 requiring a 10 minute recharge. In addition to shrines, the Divine Beasts, giant mechanical animals, act as extended puzzles, each based around a unique animal and element. Scattered across 
 Hyrule are small puzzles that reveal Korok Seeds, which can be traded to expand inventory size for weapons, shields, and bows.[16] Towns serve as hotspots for quests, sidequests, and shops selling
 materials and clothing. Hikers and other travelers offer sidequests, hints, or conversation. Additionally, players can scan Amiibo figures against their controller to summon items or call 
 Link's horse Epona from previous Zelda games and Wolf Link from Twilight Princess.
