Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.
In ancient times, the ancient Sheikah race had developed Hyrule into an advanced civilization,
 protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous 
 weapons called Guardians. When an ancient evil known as Calamity Ganon appeared and threatened 
 Hyrule, four great warriors were given the title of Champion, and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts
 to weaken Ganon while the princess with the blood of the goddess and her appointed knight fought and defeated
 him by sealing him away.
</p>
<p>
Ten millennia later,the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state.Reading their 
ancestors' prophecies, Hyrule's peoples recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding areas 
to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.During this time, Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken
 the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while trying to maintain her personal research. In the meantime, a knight
 was appointed to protect her: Link, a Hylian who was chosen due to his ability to wield the Master Sword, also known 
 as "the sword that seals the darkness". After being sought out by Zelda, the Champions—Mipha, princess of the 
 aquatic Zora; Revali, archer of the birdlike Rito; Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Gorons; and Urbosa, chief 
 of the desert-dwelling Gerudo—assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, Vah Rudania, and Vah 
 Naboris, respectively) while Zelda and Link would face Ganon directly.
</p>
<p>
However, when Ganon appeared on Zelda's seventeenth birthday, he possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, 
turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, much of the kingdom was laid to waste, 
and Link was gravely wounded protecting Zelda while on their way to Fort Hateno. Zelda had Link taken 
to safety for him to heal, hid the Master Sword in Korok Forest under the protection of the Great Deku Tree,
 and used her light magic to seal herself and Ganon in Hyrule Castle. This cataclysmic tragedy came to be
 known over time as the Great Calamity.
</p>
<p>
A century after being placed in a healing chamber in the Shrine of Resurrection, an amnesiac Link awakens 
in a now-ravaged Hyrule. He meets an old man, who eventually reveals himself as the lingering spirit of King 
Rhoam. Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown stronger; he pleads for Link to defeat 
Ganon before he regains his full strength, breaks free, and destroys the world.
</p>
<p>
Link reunites with Impa, a Sheikah elder who previously served the royal family, and she instructs him to free 
the Divine Beasts. Link travels across Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories.
 At the behest of Hyrule's peoples, he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of the Blight Ganons, freeing
 the captive spirits of Hyrule's fallen Champions and allowing them to pilot the Divine Beasts once again. In this
 endeavor, Link is assisted by Sidon, the Zora prince and Mipha's younger brother; Yunobo, Daruk's cowardly descendant; 
 Teba, a Rito warrior; and Riju, the child chief of the Gerudo. After obtaining the Master Sword from Korok Forest,
 Link enters Hyrule Castle and confronts Ganon. The Divine Beasts weaken him, and after Link defeats him, he transforms
 into Dark Beast Ganon in an attempt to destroy the world. Zelda gives Link the Bow of Light, which allows him to weaken
 Ganon enough for Zelda to seal him away, restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the Champions to depart 
 to the afterlife. Sensing their presence, Link and Zelda smile fondly.
</p>
<p>
If players have found all thirteen memories in the "Captured Memories" main quest, they unlock a post-credits cutscene 
in which Zelda declares that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the process by themselves.
 As Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and embark to restore it to—and perhaps beyond—its former glory, the princess confides 
 in him that although her powers may have dwindled over time, she has come to terms with it.
